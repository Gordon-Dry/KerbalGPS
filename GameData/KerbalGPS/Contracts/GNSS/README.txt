The original contracts written by @Nightingale were only for Kerbin, Mun
and Minmus

The Kerbin contract has been slightly modified to use the Homeworld()
parameter, and some typos have been fixed

The Mun and Minmus contracts have been disabled, and replaced with the
All-GNSS contract, which will automatically generate contract for any
planetary bodies in whatever planet pack is loaded.

If you wish to use the original contracts, delete the All-GNSS and rename the
two files:

	Mun-GNSS.cfg.orig   to Mun-GNSS.cfg
	Minmus-GNSS.cfg.orig to Minmus-GNSS.cfg
