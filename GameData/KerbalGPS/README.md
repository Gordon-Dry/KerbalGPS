# KerbalGPS
A simple GPS system for Kerbal Space Program.

What if Kerbals couldn’t just reach into the fabric of their universe to determine their position? What if, like us, they needed to develop technology to measure their position with any certainty?

The Kerbal Space Program forum’s “KARPA GPS Challenge” thread gave me the idea to develop an actual working GNSS plugin for the game. The result is a plugin that works the same way that the real global navigation satellite systems do! It calculates your vessel’s position by measuring distance to GNSS satellites in known positions in orbit. 

Now you can Launch your own Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellation, and then start using your own working GNSS network by adding the GNSS receiver module to any part in your spacecraft!

HOW TO USE

Launch a constellation of satellites. They should be well distributed around the globe. Ideally, there should be a minimum of four satellites visible from any point on the entire surface of Kerbin at all times. The higher you place your satellites in orbit, the fewer satellites you'll need to launch and maintain.

Each of the satellites in your GNSS constellation must have a GNSS transmitter part installed or they won't be detected by the Figaro receiver. Mount the transmitter part on single purpose, or on multi-purpose satellites.

Add the Figaro GNSS receiver part to your spacecraft to start navigating using your GPS network.
